In this Bootcamp I set up a database on MongoDB, created a schema for my JSON data, created MONGO documents based on the JSON data, and wrote certain queries to perform on my database. Everything works correctly and there are no bugs. However, after running a program it is necessary to use ^C to end the process as it will not end on its own.
